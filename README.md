Authors: Benny Schärer, Sophia Menger, Tobia Schärli

## Getting started

The main scene entry point can be found under "src/scenes/main".
For a guideline on Godot coding style please refer to [Coding Guide](docs/coding_guide.md).

## Feature overview

A small overview over the features to implement are here:

* Two character classes, ranged and melee.
* Third person camera and a simple character that can walk, jump, attack with a small combo.
* 1 to 3 Enemies and a Boss enemy.
* Some random aspect to the levels. (The levels are static at the moment)
